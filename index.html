        <h2>About the Department</h2>

        The Department of Computer science and Engineering (CSE) was established in the year 1984 to meet the needs of
        the
        emerging IT industry and research. The department started with an initial intake of 60 students in the UG
        program in CSE
        and enhanced its intake to 120 in the year 1994. In 1998, the department started a PG program in “Computer
